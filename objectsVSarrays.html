	<!-- Warm-up: arrays and loops -->

	<!-- Write a for loop that modifies an array of actors, making them awesome! For example, if your starting array is

	var actors = ["Tom Hanks", "Leonardo di Caprio", " Jennifer Lawrence", "Daniel Radcliffe"];
	then after you run your loop, actors should look like this:

	 ["Awesome Tom Hanks", "Awesome Leonaro di Caprio", "Awesome Jennifer Lawrence", "Awesome Daniel Radcliffe"];
	Hint: Youâ€™ll need to reassign values to the array at each index. This just means assigning a new value at an existing position in the array. For example, to make the first actor awesome, you could say:

	actors[0] = "Awesome " + actors[0]; -->
	
	<script>
		var i = 0
		var actors = ["Tom Hanks", "Leonardo di Caprio", " Jennifer Lawrence", "Daniel Radcliffe"];
		for (i = 0; i < actors.length; i++) {
			document.write("Awesome " + actors[i] + "<br>");
		}
	</script>
